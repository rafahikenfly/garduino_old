# garduino

Is an open source gardening automation project.
It aims to make it easy to keep you garden and to grow your own food.

There are several projects like this online. I'm just trying to get te very best of each of them and to learn coding and electronics in the way. All my efforts are for:

1. A totally open source project
All code, diagrams, sketches, drawings, everything should be open source. If you notice that something is not published, feel free to ask me :) Also, all the process should be avaiable for consulting. I noticed that a large project for a guy that knows nothing like me is a great learning process. I'll keep a blog for it (www.garduino.com.br/blog) - in portuguese, please google translate it if you need!

2. A totally do-it-yourself project
All the project should be do-it-yourselfable. That means: do you want to craft your own printed circuit board? No problem, masks and diagrams are here. Do you want to 3D print your own plastic components? No problem, models are here. Do you want to use your own server? No problem, database structure is here. I'm trying myself doing it from scratch, join me! To keep with the first directive, all software/files should be open-souce software compatible (below, list of software used).

3. A collaborative project
As a not-engineer, not-programmer, I really need your help. Anything you want to improve in my project is welcome. Just to keep with the second directive, I really would like to know what is behind colaboration codes - I'm really curious!


Softwares used so far:
* Arduino IDE
Used for programmin electronics. Libraries actually used are here in Github.
* Fritzing
Used for creating and producing diagrams and printed circuit boards
* PHP
Used for web interface. I just used the one my host plan offered.
* MySQL
Used for hosting a online database


Hardware used so far
* Arduino UNO R3
* Arduino Wi-fi shield
* DHT 11 Sensor
* RTC Module (IC DS1302)
* Rain Sensor (Laboratorio de Garagem)
* Groove Moisture Sensor (2 pieces)

Board of materials (besides hardware previously mentioned)
* 1 10k resistor
* 3 N 4007 rectifier diodes
* 1 photoresistor
